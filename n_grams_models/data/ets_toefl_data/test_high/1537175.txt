I definitely think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , rather then specialising in one specific subject .
Firstly , in my opi it is necessary to have a broad view on a variety of subjects in order to understand our increasingly complex world .
Secondly , innovation , whether in the fields of science , business or politics , is often lead by people who have a cross-funtional view .

To begin with , the primary purpose of education is to prepare students to face the world with the right skills and knowledge .
The world we live in , it turns out , is increasingly complex .
In order to succeed in this world , it is necessary to have a broad understanding of several subjects .
For example , an engineer can not rely only on its engineering skills but should also communicate on what he is doing , as most of the great technical achievements of our times rely on a team rather then a single person .

Then , a lot of innovations result from applying a principle or idea taken from one field and applying it to another , which can only be achieved by people who have a broad understanding of several fields .
The post-it is a good illustration .
It has become a popular and useful item in offices but it actually results from the invention of a glue that did not fix well enough to be used in a traditional way !
Another striking example is the bridge that was created between computer science and biology in the invention of neuronal programming .
Neuronal programming simulates the mechanisms of the nervous cells of the brain , enabling the programme to learn .

As a conclusion , I think that students benefit from having a broad knowledge of several subjects , because it helps them to tackle with the challenges of our modern world , whether as leaders or as innovators .
Of course , this should not prevent them from acquiring more extensive knowledge in a specific field .
