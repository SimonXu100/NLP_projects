Traveling with a tour guide is far more efficient than traveling alone .
Arriving in an unknown location may cause nerves or ultimatley , get one lost .
When one travels in a group with a guide , one is able to obtain much more background information than by bieng alone .
This information will make every penny worth 's while .
In addition , being with a guide can also mean safety .
A guide is an experienced professional that knows where and when to take one .

Getting off of the plane and wondering where to go can be frustrating .
People that undergo this frustartion may even become so distratced as to leave thier luggage behind .
Also , when one arrives , one is not sure exaclty where to go and by which means .
If one gives a taxi driver the wrong address , one will be having to spend one 's money and time .
All this precious time that could be spent in viewing new places , is spent in figuring out how to get to the hotel or guessing the locationin which one is in .

After being able to arrive to the hotel , and ready to extract the essence of that place , one is not sure of what that means .
Most of the time , when being in an unknown country , one is not completey familiar with the native language .
It is extra difficult to communicate or express one 's thoughts .
Finally , in the museum , taking pictures of the beautiful arts , one begins to think of what it is or who has done it .
If one had been in a tour guide , one would have learned who has created the masterpieces , what it is , what is its symbolic value or when it was done .
This information will not sporadically get into one 's mind .

Wanting to retrun from that exhausting trip , merely surving , one gets robbed , cheated on or smuggled .
Usually , tourists who are not accsutomed to traveling or are not advised , are easily identified in foreign lands face danger .
Safety is a great issue that foreigners face .

Therefore , in order to enjoy the trip , it is recommended to go with a tour group .
