Many people choose to specialize in one specific subject such as biology , litrature , or business .
Yet , there are people who have abroad knowlegde of many acadamic fields all together .

It is important for a person to expand its knowledge by studying different subjects in different fields .
Studying different subjects will help people understand more of what is around them .
If a person studies economics for instance , he/she will understand the economy country very well .
But can this person complete this subject without using math ?
Therefore , many programs were built to help students obtain a sense of link between subjects .
An example of these programs is MYP and PYP , where students are teached to creat a linkage between health and economics for example .

If a person has no knowledge in other subjects he will be lost in many parts of this world .
For example , if a scientist has specialized in science and only science , he would have a great knowlegde about biology and chemistry but he would be a stranger to other subjects .
He would not understand politics .
He would not understand the world around him and what is happening other than in his scientific point of view which has nothing to do with politics and such fields .

Having broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects helps in communicating with others .
For instance , people from different fields can share talks among themselves .
A scientist will be able to chat about litrature with a historian or an engineerer .
It will be easier to make friends and chatting mates .

A person with only a specialized subject will have a hard time dealing with his work .
It might be hard for him to find a job or work at his job when it comes to dealing with other areas other than his field .
This is why many companies and banks work on training their employees to have them learn more about different subjects .

This is why I think that having a abroad knowledge is better than specializing in one area or feild .
